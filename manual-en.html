	<h2><a id="Objective_of_the_game_2"></a>Objective of the game</h2>
	<p>In spite of the name, the game consists in discovering all the boxes of the board that <strong>not</strong> contains mines, avoiding the ones they have</p>
	<h2><a id="How_to_play_6"></a>How to play</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To open a box simply click on it, see that it has changed its contents by:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A number</strong> between 1 and 8: There are that number of mines near the cell.</li>
				<li><strong>Void</strong>: There are no mines nearby. Cells are automatically opened until “numbered” cells are found.</li>
				<li><strong>A mine with red background</strong>: Bad luck :( You have hit a mine and you have lost the game.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can lock a cell with a long press and a flag will appear. To be able to open the cell, again make a long press.</li>
		<li>To start a new game click on the face button.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a id="Game_Modes_15"></a>Game Modes</h2>
	<p>This game has 3 different predefined levels and the possibility of creating new configurations with the limitations (for usability) that appear in the following table:</p>
	<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Level</th>
				<th>Size</th>
				<th>Mines</th>
				<th>% Mines</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Easy</td>
				<td>8</td>

	</table>
	<h2><a id="Sounds_25"></a>Sounds</h2>
	<p>If you have pressed in a cell without a mine you will hear a sound that identifies the contents of the cell.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you hear a beep, there are an odd number of mines nearby.</li>
		<li>If you hear 2 beeps, there are an even number of mines nearby.</li>
		<li>The more mines there are, the sharper it will be. Therefore, the most tomb sounds are for 1 or 2 mines, and the sharpest for 7 or 8 mines.</li>
		<li>If you press on an empty cell you will hear a scale with the 4 sounds used in the previous cases (from serious to sharp).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When the game is over there is also a scale of sounds, from the most serious to the sharpest if you win, and from sharpest to the most serious if you lose.</p>
